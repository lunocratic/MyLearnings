# Personal Learning Dump

This repo is my personal learning dump.

I use it to store all the code, notes, and experiments while learning different languages, tools, and concepts.

## Structure

- Each folder represents a topic or language.
- Inside each folder, I dump whatever I'm learning: scripts, test files, configs, fixes, etc.
- This isn't a tutorial repo. It's just for me to track my progress and not forget things.

## Why

- To see how much I've learned over time.
- To avoid Googling the same stuff again.
- To have one place for all trial and error and working code.
